# Running Interactive Python Programs in a Docker Container

This project demonstrates how to run an **interactive** Python program inside a Docker container.  
For the demo, we created a simple program that **takes two numbers from the user** and prints their sum.

---
We have a basic Python script `app.py` that:
1. Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2. Calculates their sum.
3. Displays the result.

We also uploaded this roject image on Hub.  

The main goal is to show that **Docker containers can also run programs in interactive mode**, not just automated scripts.
